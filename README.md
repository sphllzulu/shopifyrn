Redux Store
The app uses Redux for state management, with the following slices:

AuthSlice:

Manages user authentication state.

Actions: login, logout, restoreSession.

Persists user data using AsyncStorage.

ShoppingListSlice:

Manages shopping list items.

Actions: addItem, updateItem, togglePurchased, removeItem, initializeUserItems.

Persists user-specific shopping lists using AsyncStorage.

Components
AuthScreen:

Handles user login and signup.

Validates input fields and dispatches the login action.

ShoppingList:

Displays the user's shopping list.

Allows adding, editing, and deleting items.

Includes a logout button.

AddItemModal:

A modal for adding or editing shopping list items.

Includes fields for item name, quantity, and category.

Authentication Flow
Login:

User enters username and password.

Dispatches the login action, which updates the Redux state and saves user data to AsyncStorage.

Navigates to the ShoppingList screen.

Logout:

Dispatches the logout action, which clears the Redux state and removes user data from AsyncStorage.

Navigates back to the AuthScreen.

Session Restoration:

On app startup, the restoreSession action checks AsyncStorage for saved user data and restores the session if found.

Shopping List Management
Adding Items:

Users can add items via the AddItemModal.

Items are saved to the Redux store and AsyncStorage.

Editing Items:

Users can edit item details (name, quantity, category) via the AddItemModal.
